# Library Managment System with Node.js & Sequelize
A library management system for a small library. The goal of this project was to create a more intuitive way of handling the library's books, patrons, and loans. Node, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize are used to create a dynamic website that properly shows the associations between books, patrons and loans.
